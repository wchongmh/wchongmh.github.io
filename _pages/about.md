### Building the Future, Sustainably  
I’m a **Chartered Engineer in Training** specializing in Building Services Engineering, driven by a mission to harmonize technical precision with poetic sustainability. Recognized as the **#1 ranked student** in my cohort at Glasgow Caledonian University and a recipient of the fully-funded [Alistair Harvey Foundation Scholarship]([https://example.com](https://www.vtc.edu.hk/home/en/media-newsroom/vtc-digest/ive-engineering-students-conferred-scholarship-for-pursuing-professional-development-in-uk.html)), I bridge cutting-edge tools (BIM, IoT, AI) with climate-responsive design to create smarter, greener built environments.

#### 🔧 Technical Leadership  
- **Optimized 1,200+ Public Housing Units** at Wong & Ouyang (BSE) Ltd. using BIM clash detection, achieving **12% material savings** while ensuring BEAM Plus Gold compliance.  
- **Pioneered Smart HVAC Prototypes** using Raspberry Pi and TensorFlow to predict maintenance needs, reducing system downtime by **18%** in simulations.  
- **Authored Award-Winning Research** on rooftop renewable energy feasibility, demonstrating **25% carbon reduction potential** for university campuses.  

#### 🏆 Honors & Impact  
- **Alistair Harvey Scholar** | **SCEBE Prize Winner** | **HKIE Outstanding Student**  
- Led **IVE’s Engineering Society** to revamp curricula with BIM/AI training, preparing 150+ students for Industry 4.0 challenges.  
- Spearheaded ASHRAE technical talks on CIBSE TM52 thermal comfort models, boosting student engagement by **40%**.  

#### 🌍 Sustainable Innovation  
My engineering philosophy centers on:  
1. **Passive Design First**: Prioritizing natural ventilation and daylighting.  
2. **Active Efficiency**: Deploying IoT-driven systems for real-time energy optimization.  
3. **Renewable Integration**: Advocating for photovoltaic retrofits in high-density urban areas.  

Diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD, I’ve transformed neurodiversity into a superpower—**pattern recognition** for system optimization and **hyperfocus** for complex problem-solving.
