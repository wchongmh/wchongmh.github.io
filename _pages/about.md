### Building the Future, Sustainably  
As a **Building Services Engineer**, I specialize in integrating **sustainability, smart technologies, and efficiency** into modern infrastructure. I hold a **BEng (Hons) in Building Services Engineering** from **Glasgow Caledonian University**, where I graduated [**ranked first in my cohort**](https://www.gcu.ac.uk/aboutgcu/universitynews/celebrating-success-in-the-school-of-computing,-engineering-and-built-environment) and was awarded the prestigious, [**fully funded Alistair Harvey Foundation Scholarship**](https://www.vtc.edu.hk/home/en/media-newsroom/vtc-digest/ive-engineering-students-conferred-scholarship-for-pursuing-professional-development-in-uk.html). 

With expertise in **HVAC, acoustics, lighting, pipe networks, and fire safety**, I design, optimize, and implement critical building systems. I leverage **BIM, IoT, and AI** to create **climate-responsive, intelligent spaces**, ensuring that modern engineering solutions are both technologically advanced and environmentally responsible.

I am always eager to collaborate on **innovative projects** that push the boundaries of **smart and sustainable engineering**. Let's build the future together!"

#### 🔧 Technical Leadership  
- **Optimized 1,200+ Public Housing Units** at Wong & Ouyang (BSE) Ltd. using BIM clash detection, achieving **12% material savings** while ensuring BEAM Plus Gold compliance.  
- **Pioneered Smart HVAC Prototypes** using Raspberry Pi and TensorFlow to predict maintenance needs, reducing system downtime by **18%** in simulations.  
- **Authored Award-Winning Research** on rooftop renewable energy feasibility, demonstrating **25% carbon reduction potential** for university campuses.  

#### 🏆 Honors & Impact  
- **Alistair Harvey Scholar** | **SCEBE Prize Winner** | **HKIE Outstanding Student**  
- Led **IVE’s Engineering Society** to revamp curricula with BIM/AI training, preparing 150+ students for Industry 4.0 challenges.  
- Spearheaded ASHRAE technical talks on CIBSE TM52 thermal comfort models, boosting student engagement by **40%**.  

#### 🌍 Sustainable Innovation  
My engineering philosophy centers on:  
1. **Passive Design First**: Prioritizing natural ventilation and daylighting.  
2. **Active Efficiency**: Deploying IoT-driven systems for real-time energy optimization.  
3. **Renewable Integration**: Advocating for photovoltaic retrofits in high-density urban areas.  

Diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD, I’ve transformed neurodiversity into a superpower—**pattern recognition** for system optimization and **hyperfocus** for complex problem-solving.
